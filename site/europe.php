              <h3>Education System</h3>
              <p>Higher education is provided by universities and universities of applied sciences (introduced in 1994). There are also Academies (e.g. Teacher Training Colleges).

At private universities, study programmes can be offered either in accordance with state programmes and degrees, or without reference to them.</p>
              <p>Austria combines a long tradition in higher education with state-of-the-art research. The Austrian higher education institutions offer an ever-growing number of degree programmes: you can choose between first-class research-based courses at the Austrian universities, world-famous education at the universities of the arts, high-quality practice-oriented degree courses at the universities of applied sciences, sound, up-to-date teacher education and innovative courses at private universities. International students are of special concern to all Austrian higher education institutions.

    <h1>FAQs</h1><hr>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
      <li><h4>1)Can I apply to as many programmes as I want?</h4>
      <p>
      While it is usually possible to apply to more than one study programme, there may be a limit to how many alternatives you can choose. Please check the details on the admission sites.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking it is usually a good idea to concentrate on applying to a few programmes that you are really interested in, rather than sending in as many applications as possible just for the sake of getting “any study placement whatsoever”.</p></li>
      <li><h4>2)Do I need to take an English language test?</h4>
      <p>
      This depends on the programme you are applying to, but most degree programmes require that you prove your English language proficiency by means of an internationally accepted test (TOEFL/IELTS etc). Please check this and other detailed requirements in the admissions instructions of the institution you are applying to. If your native language is English, or if you can prove that your previous education has been completed in English, you may be exempt from the language test requirement.</p></li>
      <li><h4>3)I can not speak Finnish. Is it possible to study in English in Finland?</h4>
      <p>
      Yes. Finnish universities and polytechnics offer a wide selection of degree options taught in English.</p></li>
      <li><h4>4)Do I need to study the Finnish language in Finland?</h4>
      <p>
      If you apply to an English-language programme, it is not usually compulsory to study Finnish, but it is strongly recommended since it would help you a lot in your everyday life to know at least the basics of our language. Furthermore, Finnish language skills may be an important asset in finding part-time work during your studies, or employment in Finland after your graduation.</p></li>

    Sweden is located on the east side of the Scandinavian Peninsula in northern Europe. It has nine million inhabitants of which almost two million live in and around the capital, Stockholm. The official language is Swedish. Sweden has been a constitutional monarchy since 1809, and has had a parliamentary system of government since 1719. Despite its natural riches, Sweden is a country built on people. Today, knowledge is Sweden’s prime asset, with education kept in the public domain and developed to a standard that ranks consistently among the highest in OECD statistics.

There are a total of 61 universities, university colleges and Since taking part in the Bologna Process, a Europe-wide cooperation to harmonise all higher education, there have been major changes in the Swedish university system. A three-level degree structure was introduced in 2007:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><p><b>Undergraduate studies</b> - The Hogskoleexamen (diploma) is awarded after a completion of at least 120 credits. The Kandidatexamen (bachelors degree) is conferred after the completion of at least 180 credits, equivalent to three years of </p></li>
              full-time study. Professional degrees in medicine, pharmaceutical studies, psychology, dentistry, architecture, civil engineering and law could last between four to six years; 
              <li><p><b>Masterexamen’s studies - </b>There are two kinds of masters courses leading to two different degrees. The Magisteraxamen lasts for one year and the Masterexamen lasts for two years. Apart from these academic degrees, there are some 60 professional
              degrees (Yrkesexamen), which vary in length depending on their field of study;</p></li>

    <p>
     <b>Italy</b>, officially the <b>Italian Republic</b> is a unitary parliamentary republic in Southern Europe. To the north, Italy borders France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the Italian Peninsula and the two biggest Mediterranean islands of Sicily and Sardinia.<br>
Italy is considered to be both a major regional power and a leading middle power with membership in prominent institutions such as the UN, the EU, the NATO, the OECD, the OSCE, the DAC, the WTO, the G4, G6, G7, G8, G10, G20, the Union for the Mediterranean, the Latin Union, the Council of Europe, the Central European Initiative and the Uniting for Consensus.

        </p><h3>Education System</h3><hr>
          <p>Italy has played an important role in European higher education: it is one of the four countries that first engaged to create the so-called European Area of Higher Education, thus starting that type of higher education reform which, known as Bologna Process (Bologna Declaration, June 1999) is being implemented all over Europe.</p>
          <p>The education system in Italy is organised according to the subsidiary principle and autonomy of schools. The State has exclusive competence on general issues on education, on minimum standards to be guaranteed throughout the country and on the fundamental principles that Regions should comply with within their competences.</p>
          <p>Italian higher education is structured in a binary system, consisting of two main articulations:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>The university sector</li>
          <li>The non-university sector.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>At present, the university sector is made up of 89 university institutions which are classified in:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>58 State universities</li>
          <li>17 non-State universities (legally recognised by the State)</li>
          <li>2 universities for foreigners</li>
          <li>6 higher schools specialised in postgraduate university studies\</li>
          <li>6 telematic universities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><b>Intakes:</b></p>
          <p>The academic year in Italy is made up of two semesters. The first semester starts in September/October and ends in January/February. The second semester starts in February and ends in July. The actual start and finish dates will vary in the different universities but each semester lasts around 20 weeks and is made up of a teaching period lasting around 14 weeks and an exam period lasting around 6 weeks. </p>
          <b>Requirements:</b>

           <p>The Italian Masters Degree should not be confused with Italian Masters (Magistrale specialistica) that are one-year specialist courses which offer a more practical education, notably in professional areas such as law, engineering, education or architecture) but do not give access to further levels of studies (they can be considered similar to Postgraduate diplomas). A bachelor (or an international equivalent) is required to undertake a Masters degree.</p>
          <p>If you are applying for an international program (the Italian equivalent to being delivered in English) or an Erasmus Mundus joint-Masters programme there may be no entrance examination. If you are applying for Masters degrees in the area of economics, management, finance, business studies, you are likely to be asked for a GMAT or GRE, and Proof of English Knowledge is required notably if the program you are applying to is in English.</p>
          <p><b>Popular Universities:</b></p>
          <ol>
          <li>University of Bologna</li>
          <li>University of Milan</li>
          <li>University of Pavia</li>
          <li>University of Genoa</li>
          <li>University of Siena</li>
          <li>University of Pisa</li>
          <li>University of Torino</li>
          <li>University of Trento</li>
          <li>University of Bari</li>
          <li>University of Rome- Sapienza</li>
          </ol>
          <p></p><h4>Education and Living Costs:</h4><p></p>

          <p><b>Tuition Fees:</b></p>

          <p>Universities and other Higher Education Institutes establish their own fees but in the case of university education there is a legal minimum fee for enrolment and maximum level for student contributions to costs and services, which cannot exceed 20% of state funding.</p>

          <p>The average fees a student has to pay is somewhere between 850 euro and 1,000 euro per year since this varies from one university to another and also depends on the chosen course of study. Private universities are clearly much more expensive.</p>

          <p>Admission to master universitari and other specialisation courses also have much higher fees. Doctoral students who receive a grant from the university do not pay fees, but non- grant holders are required to pay the fees, which will vary again according to the university chosen.</p>
          <p><b>Living Costs</b></p>

          <p>The cost of living in Italy varies considerably depending on which part of Italy the student will live in. Almost all of the main cities and tourist places, especially the ones located in the north of Italy are comparatively more expensive than other cities and smaller towns of the country.</p>
            

    

    

    
      <p>
        </p><h3>Scholarship Opportunities</h3>

    <p>
     <b>Finland</b>, officially the <b>Republic of Finland</b>, is a Nordic country situated in the Fennoscandian region of Northern Europe. It is bordered by Sweden to the west, Norway to the north, Russia to the east, and Estonia to the south across the Gulf of Finland.
Finland was a relative latecomer to industrialization, remaining a largely agrarian country until the 1950s. Thereafter, it rapidly developed an advanced economy while building an extensive Nordic-style welfare state, resulting in widespread prosperity and one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. Subsequently, Finland is a top performer in numerous metrics of national performance, including education, economic competitiveness, civil liberties, quality of life, and human development. Finland is one of the best country in the world. Finland is also a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the World Trade Organization.

        </p><h3>Education System</h3><hr>
          <p>Higher education has a significant role in Finnish society and the national innovation system: higher education is crucial when working towards a world-class knowledge society.</p>
          <p>Finnish higher education consists of two parts:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Universities provide academic education based on research. All 14 universities offer Bachelor’s, Masters, licentiate and doctoral degrees (3 + 2 + 4 years).</li>
          <li>Universities of Applied Sciences (polytechnics) provide vocational education on a higher level and promote applied research. Polytechnics confer Bachelor’s (from 3.5 up to 4 years) and Master’s (1 – 1.5 years) degrees. A student is eligible for polytechnic/UAS Master’s level studies after accomplishing a Bachelor’s degree, and having acquired at least three years of relevant work experience after that.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>All studies are quantified as credits (ECTS, European Credit Transfer System). One year of full-time study corresponds to 60 credits</p>
          <h5><b>Intakes:</b></h5>

          <p>The academic year in Finland is divided into two terms: Autumn term (from August/September to December) and Spring term (from January to the end of May)</p>
          <p>Most degree programmes only accept new degree students at the beginning of the academic year. So, usually your application will concern studies that start in the autumn term (August/September). In some cases, however, it may be possible to apply for studies that start in the spring term (January).</p>
          <p>During the so-called summer term (June-August) it may be possible for already registered students to complete some individual course modules, but generally speaking it is holiday time and there is no separate summer term intake for degree studies.</p>
          <h5><b>Requirements:</b></h5>

          <b><h5>Applying to Bachelors programmes</h5></b>
          <ul>
          <li>Hold educational certificates that make you eligible to apply for higher education in your home country</li>
          <li>fulfill the English language skills requirements (and other possible programme-specific requirements) as set by the receiving institution</li>
          <li>successfully pass an entrance examination</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that the Finnish higher education system does not include certificate or diploma/advanced diploma level degrees. If you currently hold a one-year or two-year certificate or diploma degree, and are applying to an undergraduate programme in Finland, it is likely that your application would be based on your upper secondary school certificates rather than your certificate/diploma degree. See our FAQ on the subject!</p>
          <p>If you are admitted, it may be possible for you to receive some credit point compensation based on your previous higher education studies, but this you should negotiate with the Finnish higher education institution after youve been admitted. It is up to the policies and decisions of the individual higher education institutions whether such credit point compensation can be awarded.</p>
          <b><h5>Applying to Master’s / Doctoral programmes</h5></b><br>
          <p>If you already hold a higher education qualification from your home country, and are applying to a Masters or Doctoral level programme in Finland, then your eligibility is decided based on</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the extent and quality of your earlier academic qualifications - usually a three-year Bachelors is the minimum</li>
          <li>your language skills and other possible faculty-specific requirements</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that Master level programmes at polytechnics (UAS) additionally require that applicants hold a Bachelor degree followed by three (3) years of relevant work experience. The UAS Master programmes are primarily targeted fro those already in the working life. The Master programmes offered by the universities, as opposed to the polytechnic/UAS Master, do not usually have any work experience requirements, unless otherwise specified in the entry criteria of the university Master programme in question.</p>
          <h6>Popular Universities:</h6>
          <ul>
          <li>Aalto University</li>

          <h4>Education and living costs</h4>
        
          <h5>Tuition Fee:</h3>

          <p>In Finland, education is funded by the government and students both EU/non EU and international are exempted from fee payment. Universities in Finland have no tuition fees! Education is subsidized by the state through the ministry of education, and  students are exempted from fee payment. This also applies to the international degree students and visiting students as well.</p>
          <h5>Living Cost</h5>

          <p>The average monthly living expenses for a student may vary a bit, depending on your study location in Finland – for example, accommodation and other living costs may be higher in the Helsinki metropolitan area and other larger cities.</p>
          <p>As a student you can get discounts in student restaurants and cafeterias, public transport, etc.</p>

        <p></p>

   

   
      <p>
        
        </p><p>The Finnish Government has offered the Scholarships for postgraduate studies or research (after Master’s level but no for post-Doctoral and research) and that priority will be given to doctoral studies.</p>

    </p><h3>Visa</h3><hr>
    <p>A person intending to stay in Finland for a period of over 90 days is required to have a visa.</p>
        <p><strong>Documents needed for entry to Finland:-</strong></p>
      <p><span>When arriving in Finland you may also be expected to show, in addition to your visa and a valid travel document, insurance document for the duration of your stay and other documents related to your stay in Finland. You must prove that you have sufficient funds (EUR 40 per day or a scholarship or a training placement) for your stay and for your return journey or further travel.</span></p>
      <p><span>If you would ordinarily need a visa but have a residence permit valid in one of the Schengen countries, you do not need a visa to enter another Schengen country if the intended duration of your stay is no more than 90 days.</span></p>
      <p><span><strong>Formalities:-</strong></span></p>
      <p><span>If you are a foreign national requiring a visa, you must always have one when entering the Schengen area. A Schengen visa is applied for from the embassy or consulate of the destination country. So when coming to Finland, you are requested to apply for it either from a Finnish embassy or consulate or from a mission of a Schengen country that represents Finland. For admission of visa one is always required to have valid travel insurance together with other documents.</span></p>
      <p><span>Upon submitting the application candidates are also required to submit a copy of their passport. Original passports would only be required for authentication. The embassy has the reserve right for asking any other authentication. Incomplete applications would not be accepted .All regulations consular fees or services are subject to change without any prior notice</span></p>

    </p><h3>F.A.Q</h3><hr>
    <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
      <li><h6>1)Can I apply to as many programmes as I want?</h6>
      <p>
      While it is usually possible to apply to more than one study programme, there may be a limit to how many alternatives you can choose. Please check the details on the admission sites.</p>
      <p>Generally speaking it is usually a good idea to concentrate on applying to a few programmes that you are really interested in, rather than sending in as many applications as possible just for the sake of getting “any study placement whatsoever”.</p></li>
      <li><h6>2)Do I need to take an English language test?</h6>
      <p>
      This depends on the programme you are applying to, but most degree programmes require that you prove your English language proficiency by means of an internationally accepted test (TOEFL/IELTS etc). Please check this and other detailed requirements in the admissions instructions of the institution you are applying to. If your native language is English, or if you can prove that your previous education has been completed in English, you may be exempt from the language test requirement.</p></li>
      <li><h6>3)I can not speak Finnish. Is it possible to study in English in Finland?</h6>
      <p>
      Yes. Finnish universities and polytechnics offer a wide selection of degree options taught in English.</p></li>
      <li><h6>4)Do I need to study the Finnish language in Finland?</h6>
      <p>
      If you apply to an English-language programme, it is not usually compulsory to study Finnish, but it is strongly recommended since it would help you a lot in your everyday life to know at least the basics of our language. Furthermore, Finnish language skills may be an important asset in finding part-time work during your studies, or employment in Finland after your graduation.</p></li>

An island kingdom, it consists of the Jutland peninsula, the larger islands of Zealand, Funen, Lolland and some 480 other islands between the North and Baltic seas. A modern infrastructure and an effective welfare system allow citizens high standards of living.</p>
    <p>A clean environment is important to the Danes. As a result, most prefer to ride their bike. Almost everyone has one and uses it daily. In cities, small towns and the country-side, it is easy enough for people cycle to work or school as there are special cycle paths in all urban areas. Owing to its location and geography, Denmark has a relatively mild climate and outdoor activities are possible most of the year.    </p>

    <p>While Danish is the official language of Denmark, most Danes speak excellent English and many understand German. Nevertheless, being able to speak some Danish will benefit you both socially and if you want to look for a job.

    The university academic year begins on 1 October and finishes on 30 September of the following calendar year. Most universities apply a system of semesters, which means that the academic year is divided into two separate teaching periods or semesters. The first semester comprises first 13 weeks of educational and study activities, concluded with 2 weeks of autumn vacation. Then there is 1 week of individual study and 3 weeks of examinations, followed by 1 week of vacation. The second semester comprises also 13 weeks of educational and study activities, but is interrupted by 2 weeks of Easter holiday. The 13 weeks are followed by 2 weeks of individual study, 3 weeks of examinations and 1 week of deliberations. The summer break of 6 weeks is followed by the second examination period, which consists of 3 weeks of examinations. Some courses need 4 weeks of examinations; in that case the summer break takes only 5 weeks. The examinations are followed by 1 week of deliberations. Between the end of the deliberations and the beginning of the new first semester one free week remains.

              <p>From the academic year 2007-2008 onwards all students from the P.R. China will have to obtain a certificate of academic screening issued by the Academic Evaluation Centre(APS) at the German Embassy in Beijing before being allowed to enroll at any higher education institution, language course or other preparatory course in the French-speaking Community of Belgium.

<h3><span style="color: #4f81bd; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt;">Education and living costs</span></h3>
<h4><span  >Tuition Fees:</span></h4>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span  >Spanish course fees are among the lowest in Europe for residents and EU nationals. Being relatively inexpensive, it is also a popular study destination for international students.This means that you are not required to pay higher course fees than Spanish students and that you are entitled to apply for any grants available to help with tuition fees.The tuition fee for studying at a public university in Spain is approx. 1,000 EUR per year.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span >Students have to pay registration and tuition fees at public universities in Spain. The total amount paid varies depending on the course and its credit worth. Enrolment fees for Bachelors degrees (180 credits or 60 credits per year) at public universities in Spain vary between 500 EUR and 1,120 EUR per academic year. The fees for official masters and doctoral degrees at public and private universities are regulated by the government. A master program is usually worth&nbsp;90-120 credits, except a Master of Science which is worth 240 credits, also 60 credits per year. As an example, a masters course comprising 60 ECTS credits may cost between 960 EUR and 1800 EUR.</span></p>
<h4><span  >Living Costs:</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;">Studies have estimated that students and researchers in Spain spend an average of 900 and 1100€ per month on living expenses, depending on the city. The differences are due mainly to the cost&nbsp;OF ACCOMMODATION (renting a flat, living in a university residence, etc.) which tends to be higher in the larger cities. On the other hand, food prices and the cost of other services tend to be quite similar all over Spain.</span></p>
